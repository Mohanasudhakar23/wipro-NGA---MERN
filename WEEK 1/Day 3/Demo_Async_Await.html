<!-- Why we need Async and Await in Js   -->
 <!-- Async and Await are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript more easily and readably. -->
    <!-- They allow you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, 
     making it easier to understand and maintain. -->
     <!-- This is particularly useful when dealing with operations like API calls, file reading, or any other tasks that take time to complete. -->
      <!-- following are the steps to implement Async/Await in JavaScript -->
    
          <li>Declare a function as async using the async keyword.</li>
          <li>Use the await keyword to pause the execution until a Promise is resolved.</li>
          <li>Handle errors using try...catch blocks.</li>

            // Here fetch returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request
            const comments = await response.json(); // Parsing the JSON response
            // Awaiting the json() method which also returns a Promise that resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON
